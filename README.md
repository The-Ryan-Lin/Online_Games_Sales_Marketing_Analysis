<h2>Context</h2> 
  <p>
  Turtle Games (TG) is a (fictional) game manufacturer and retailer with a global customer base, operating in North America and Europe. It manufactures and sells its own products and those made by other companies, including books, board games, video games, and toys. 
    
  The company collects data from sales as well as customer reviews. TG has a business objective of improving overall sales performance by analysing data on its customers and sales figures. 

In terms of its customers, TG would like to understand how customers accumulate 'loyalty points', how groups within the customer base can be used to target specific market segments and how social data (customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns. 

In terms of sales, TG would like to understand the impact that each product has on sales, the reliability of its sales data and the relationship between North American, European and Global sales.

## Turtle Games - Predicting Future Outcomes

The goal of this project was to explore customer demographic and sales data of Turtle Games, a game manufacturer and retailer with a global customer base. We were tasked to determine what can be done to improve the overall sales performance of Turtle Games, primarily through utilising customer trends. The initial set of questions given by Turtle games are show below. 
- how customers accumulate loyalty points
- how groups within the customer base can be used to target specific market segments 
- how social data (e.g. customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns the impact that each product has on sales
- how reliable the data is (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis)
- what the relationship(s) is/are (if any) between North American, European, and global sales? 
  
Two datasets were used in this analysis and can be found in the repository (including the metadata file titled "metadata_metadata_turtle_games.txt"). 
1. turtle_reviews.csv – Details on customer gender, age, remuneration, spending score, loyalty points, education, language, platform, review and summary across products.
2. turtle_sales.csv – Details of video games sold globally, such as the rank, product, platform, genre, publisher, and their sales across North America, Europe, and worldwide.

## The working order of how this project was approached is shown below and corresponds to chapters seen in the Jupyter Notebook and R file.
### Jupyter Notebook:
1. Setting Up the GitHub Repository & Importing and Exploring Data. Apply linear regression techniques to determine how customers accumulate loyalty points
2. Make predictions with clustering. apply k-means clustering to determine how useful remuneration and spending scores are in providing data for analysis.
3. Analyse customer sentiments with reviews using natural language processing (NLP) to determine how social data (e.g. customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns.
### R
4. Visualise data to gather insights. Explore and prepare the data set for analysis on the impact of sales per product.
5. Clean, manipulate  and visualise the data. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to clean and manipulate the data so that you determine how reliable the data is (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis).
6. Making recommendations to the business. Apply regression techniques to determine any possible relationship(s) in sales between North America, Europe, and global sales
